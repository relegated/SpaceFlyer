Simple Javascript project
### Version 2.0
Version 1 supported shooting, moving, enemies, enemy bullets, and a little bit more than this. But it is now a system of... errors. Version 2.0 supports all of that... and more. Turn ships with rapid mouse movement, or just use the A and D keys. Collect hearts to refill your lost life. Turn on lag mode in the new menu to play on slower computers. Watch particles explode in front of distant and near stars. And be sure to have fun!
