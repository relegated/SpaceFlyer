# SpaceFlyer
Simple Javascript project
### Version 1.0
The basic support for a simple javascript project:
	Shooting with you ship
	Movement with the mouse
	Enemies can fly down
	You can shoot bullets...
	But enemies can too
	As well as a basic restart system with [Enter]
All of a sudden, while adding new features, this entire project turned into a system of errors.
But with the new version, Version 2.0, lots of things were added...
### Version 2.0
After version 1.0 collapsed, there was no telling what went wrong.
Since we couldn't bring 1.0 back, we started all over.
Now we have this... Version 2.0 of Spaceflyer!
Version 2.0 supports all of the things that V1 had... and more. Turn ships with rapid mouse movement, or just use the A and D keys. Collect hearts to refill your lost life. Turn on lag mode in the new menu to play on slower computers. Watch particles explode in front of distant and near stars. And be sure to have fun!
